# Lions-and-Hyenas

## Why?
I made this project to practice the Design Pattern theory, because just the degree course was only theoretical and i think that the "learn by doing" way is far more effective to get into things. The structure of the project involves deeply the use of the Abstract Factory pattern, concretizing in the Factory Method pattern.

## What?
I imagined a virtual Savanna environment, with animal playing around inside (i mean, killing each other in the racef for survival).
The first thing i did was a research about the bioma itself, and in particular i was looking for a group of species that truly interact each other in the real world.
During this journey i finally found an interesting micro-system (because, of course, this model is a super-semplification of the reality)
that was fitting my needs.
The fantastic four animals population that you can play with are Lions, Hyenas, Zebras and Gnus.
The program wants to simulate the changes in populations during the time.
It wasn't a random animal choice, in fact we have two carnivores and two herbivores, with different sizes and habits, that really interact in the African Savanna.

The inspiration for the choice came from this video   (2 min)  -->   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJH7qtWr9ZA

The subtle tension and precise balance with which the two species relate to each other is impressive. Everyone knows their place in the food chain, and which is the final line that triggers the fight in front of the carcass of a prey.

## How to run the simulation
Clone the repo, and set the initial amount of each animal (you have the possibility to start with adults, or adults or puppies of each species), then you can run the simulations of how thepopulations of each species evolve suring the time.
Epochs are set to 50, but you can choose the amount that you prefer.
I also imlemented a plotting function that displays with lovely colorful lines the evolution of the environment (how many exemplars are alive during each era).
Note that populations tend to grow fast, if the conditions are favorable, thus for a high amount of epochs a not trascurable amount of computation power is required.

I attach screenshots from some interesting runs.
